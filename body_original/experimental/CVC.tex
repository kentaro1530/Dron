\subsection{Charge veto counter}
The charged veto counter (CVC) was placed at just upstream of the NC for the rejection of charged particles in the NC.
The CVC consists of 34 segmented plastic scintillators whose size is 10cm (width) $\times$ 150cm (height) $\times$ 5cm (thickness).
The scintillator was attached 2 inch Hamamatsu H6410 photomultipliers trough the Lucite light guide.
The scintillator is of Eljen EJ-200 type.
The average time resolution measured with cosmic rays is $78\pm7$ ps ($\sigma$).
The error represents the variation among the segments.
Half of the CVC counter was used for the forward proton measurement.
