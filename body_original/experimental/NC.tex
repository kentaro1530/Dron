\subsection{Neutron counter array}
The neutron counter array was placed at 14.7m downstream of the target to measure neutron comes from $d(K^-, n)$ reaction.
The NC consist of 7 layers and each layer has 16 segmented plastic scintillator whose size is 20cm (width) $\times$ 150cm (height) $\times$ 5cm (thickness).
The NC is covered $6.2^{\circ}$ in horizontal and $2.9^{\circ}$ in vertical.
The scintillators for the first 3 layers are made of Saint-Gobain BC408 and the other four layers are made of Saint-Gobain BC412.
2 inch Hamamatsu H6410 photomultipliers were attached to both sides of the scintillator through a Lucite light guide.
The average time resolution of the neutron counter, measured with cosmic rays, is $92\pm 10$ ps $(\sigma)$.
The error represnets variation among the segments.
Detection efficiency about $1.0 GeV/c$ neutron was estimated by $K^- p \rightarrow K^0 n$ reaction using $H_2$ target which is described Sec.\ref{sec:NC_eff}
