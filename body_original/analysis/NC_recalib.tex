The NC time walk effect was calibrated by $\gamma$ conversion events around the target system which was seen in Fig\ref{fig:NC_beta}.
So neutron made large energe deposit events,
$\gamma$ events was not enough for calibration of large energy deposit correction which was seen in $d(K^-, n \pi^+ \pi^-)"n"$ events that is described after section.
Fig\ref{fig:NC_recalib} shows these effect which was convert to time offset giving true PDG value of neutron.
This effect was calibrated using 3rd polynomial function which is shown in same figure.
