\chapter{Experimental setup}
%% This chapter describes the present experimental setup.
%% The present experiment was carried out at the K1.8BR beamline of the Hadron Facility at J-PARC.
%% First, a brief description of J-PARC is given, followed by a description of the Hadron Facility and the slow beam extraction there.
%% Next, the secondary beam transport and particle selection methods are described, including the electromagnet setup used for them.

%% Then, detectors in the experimental area are described.
%% These detectors consist of three main parts.
%% One is the beamline detector system for analysing the beam,
%% the second is the forward detector system for analysing the forward scattered nucleons
%% and the third is the cylindrical detector system (CDS) for measuring the particles that decay from the produced hyperons.
%% In addition, the trigger circuit and the DAQ system are described, which digitize the detector signals and import into a PC.
