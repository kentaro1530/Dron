\chapter{Analysis}
%% This chapter describes the analysis of each detector until a count-based spectrum is obtained.
%% As mentioned earlier, detector systems can be divided into beamline systems, CDS systems and forward detector systems.

%% First, the beamline system describes how to analyse and select Kaon beams
%% and estimate the beam volume by defining the fraction of the Kaon trigger that is actually irradiated to liquid deuterium and can be analysed.

%% Next, the CDS is described, and after the performance of the CDS is confirmed, the detection efficiency of the CDC is evaluated.

%% Next, the forward detector system is explained separately for forward neutrons and forward protons.
