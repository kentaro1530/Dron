\section{Cylindrical Detector System}

The cylindrical detector system (CDS) surrounds the experimental target system to measure produced charged particles.
The CDS consists of three parts, the outermost part is the solenoid magnet to make the uniform magnetic field for momentum analysis,
next is the cylindrical detector hodoscope (CDH) to measure time-of-flight from the T0 and make trigger signal,
and the cylindrical drift chamber (CDC) to measure the trajectory in the magnetic field, by which the momentum of a charged particle is analyzed.
Particle identification is performed by the momentum and T0-CDH TOF.
