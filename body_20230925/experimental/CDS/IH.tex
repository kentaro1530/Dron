\subsection{Inner Hodoscope - IH}
The inner hodoscope (IH) is a segmented plastic scintillation counter mounted on the inner wall of the CFRP cylinder of the CDC at a radius of 140mm from the beam axis.
The IH consists of 24 ELJEN EJ-200 scintillators with a dimension of 600mm in length, 27mm in width, and 3mm in thickness.
Each segment is overlapped by 1mm due to the strong magnetic field and limited space.
Readout uses the multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs) with a 3mm $\times$ 3mm sensitive area (Hamamatsu S10362-33-100C), which is attached only upstream side.
The scintillation light is collected by 4 wavelength-shifting fibers embedded in the scintillator and connected to an MPPC with a specially designed connector.
The MPPC signal is read out by using a preamplifirer.

The IH was used as a trigger counter for the efficiency estimation of the CDC.
The IH was removed in MR RUN78 to increase acceptance for the backward scattered proton.
