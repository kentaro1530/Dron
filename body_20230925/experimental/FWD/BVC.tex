\subsection{Beam Veto Counter - BVC}
\input{experimental/figs/BVC}
The BVC is installed immediately upstream of the FDC to avoid beams that did not react with the target.
Its signal is mainly used for forward neutron triggering.
The BVC are installed as horizontal counters with various width due to the vertical dependence of the particle density.
The coverage size of the BVC is 320mm (height) $\times$ 320mm (width) with 10 (thickness) of scintillators, as shwon in Table.\ref{fig:BVC}.
The scintillator is used ELJEN EJ-200.
