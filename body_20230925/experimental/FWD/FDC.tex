\subsection{Forward Drift Chamber - FDC}
\input{experimental/table/BLDC}
For forward scattered positive particles,
The forward drift chamber (FDC) is installed immediately upstream of the Ushiwaka to measure the trajectory of the charged particles before they are bent for momentum analysis.
The information is used for momentum analysis of forward-scattered positive particles for particle identification.

Each pairs are separated by a 20 mm gap using aluminised-Kapton.
The sense wires are arranged with a 6 mm gap and the electric field is created by potential wires surrounding them with squares.
The sense wires and potential wires are the same wires used in the BLC and the BPC.
% The FDC1 has a 400mm (horizontal) $times$ 300mm (vertival) open window, so its effective erea is 363mm (horizontal) $times$ 300mm (vertical) when evaluated as a rectangle.
The configuration of the BLC1/2 and the BPC and the FDC is summarized in Table.\ref{tab:chamber}.
These drift chambers is used same gas.
