\subsection{Vertex Chamber - BPC }

\input{experimental/figs/BPC}

BPC which means backward proton chamber was developed for the measurement of backward proton decayed from hyperons that come from $\pi^0\Sigma^0$ mode.
The BPC also perform beam tracking just upstream of the experimental target to define the reaction vertex point.
The BPC is installed at just upstream of the experimental target which is in the CDS described after.
The BPC is a planer type drift chamber which has a circular plane to maximize effective area in limited space, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:BPC}.
The BPC configuration is XX'YY'XX'YY', so the BPC has 8 layers.

In MR RUN69, the chamber with 168mm diameter outer which has 15 sense wires per layer with 3.6mm drift length corresponding to 111.6mm effective area is used as the BPC.
In this run, the inner hodoscope (IH) is installed in CDS for the trigger counter to evaluate CDC efficiency.

In MR RUN78,the IH is removed to maximize acceptance of backward proton so larger chamber was used as the BPC
whose outer size is 290mm diameter and 32 sense wires per layer with 3.0mm drift length corresponding to 189mm effective area.

These chambers is used 50$\mu$m diameter copper-beryllium wire for potential wires and 12.5$\mu$m diameter gold-plated tungsten.
These cathode planes are made of 9$\mu$m carbon aramid foil.
These are 120 read-outs and 256 read-outs in MR-RUN69 and MR-RUN78, respectively.
