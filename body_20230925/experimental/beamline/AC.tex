\subsection{Aerogel Cherenkov Detector}

\input{experimental/figs/AC}

An aerogel Cherenkov detector is used to make Kaon trigger, which is installed between D5 magnet and CDS.
Its radiator has a refractive index $n=1.05$, which can distinguish between Kaon and $\pi$ at $0.7\sim1.2$GeV$/c$, as shown in the right figure of Fig.\ref{fig:AC}.
The left figure shows design of the AC.
The AC has a radiator of $190$mm(width)$\times$100mm(height)$\times$100mm(thickness) and reads signals with four 3-inch fine mesh PMTs due to the leakage field from the D5 magnet and CDS.
