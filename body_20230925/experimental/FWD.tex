\section{Forward Detector System}
The forward detector system consists of a neutron detector system for detecting forward scattered neutrons
and a proton detector system for detecting protons, although some detectors are used for both purposes.

Downstream of the CDS is a beam sweep magnet, called Ushiwaka, which bends the negatively charged beam into a beam dump.
Positively charged particles are bent to the opposite side by the Ushiwaka, while neutrals fly straight.
The neutron counter (NC) is installed about 15 m downstream of the CDS to detect the neutral particles,
and the charge veto counter (CVC) is installed immediately upstream to confirm that they are not actually charged particles.

The Proton counter (PC) is installed in the opposite direction to the beam dump to detect positive charged particles.
The forward drift chamber (FDC) is installed upstream of the Ushiwaka to detect the position of positive charged particles before they are bent,
whose information is used to momentum analysis and particle identification.

The beam veto counter (BVC) is also installed immediately upstream of the FDC to detect beams that have passed through without reacting with the target, which is described.
