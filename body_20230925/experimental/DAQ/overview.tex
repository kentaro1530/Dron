\subsection{Overvies}
This section describes how the signals from the detectors described previously are converted and stored in the PC for analysis.
For this purpose,
data is collected using the TKO module \cite{TKO} and sent to the VME SMP (Supper Memory Partner) \cite{VME}xs via the TKO SCH (Supper Controller Head) and finally transferred to the PC.
There are two main types of detector: counter and chamber.
The signal from the counter is divided into two parts: one is converted into an ADC signal for the magnitude of the signal and the other into a TDC signal for the time.
Some counter signals are also used as trigger signals to transfer information from the SMP to the PC.
The counters read only the time-related TDC.
