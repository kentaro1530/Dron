The method described in the previous section focused solely on the $I=0$ component,
leaving $I=1$ and the interplay between $I=0$ and $I=1$ in the obtained spectra unexplored.
To address this limitation, we will utilize spectra derived from the DCC model to examine these contributions.
First, we fit the experimental spectra we obtained by introducing the parameters $S_{I=0}$ and $S_{I=1}$,
which adjust the strengths of $I=0$ and $I=1$ components independently.
Two versions of the DCC model, Model A and Model B, are considered.
Figures \ref{fig:fit_A_scale} and \ref{fig:fit_B_scale} correspond to cases using Model A and Model B, respectively.
For the fitting performed with Model A, the parameter for $I=0$ was reduced to $S_{I=0}=\fitAscaleIz$,
while the parameter fot $I=1$ remained nearly unchanged at $S_{I=1}=\fitAscaleIo$.
With Model B, the parameter for $I=0$ was reduced to $S_{I=0}=\fitBscaleIz$,
whereas the parameter for $I=1$ was increased to $S_{I=1}=\fitBscaleIo$.
Considering each figure, the $I=1$ spectrum appears to be in good agreement with both Models A and B.
On the other hand, the spectra for the interference term and $I=0$ seem to align reasonably well with Model B, but not with Model A.
In Model A, the fit for the interference term appears to lack intensity above the threshold, and the overall spectrum does not seem to match $I=0$.
In fact, the fitting with Model B yicelds $\chi^2/NDF=\fitBscaleChi=\fitBscaleChiNum$,
whereas the fitting with Model A is significantly worse, with $\chi^2/NDF=\fitAscaleChi=\fitAscaleChiNum$.
Table \ref{table:DCC_poles} lists the pole parameters of $\Lambda(1405)$ derived from the DCC model,
where Pole1, the higher of the two poles, significantly affects the observed spectrum.
In model A, the imaginary part, or width, of that parameter is large,
resulting in a pronounced tail of the $I=0$ spectrum below the $\bar{K}N$ threshold,
thus preventing accurate reproduction of the observed spectrum.

In more detail, the fitting in model B reveals that both the $I=0$ and $I=1$ spectra seem to
lack intensity compared to the theoretical spectrum above the $\bar{K}N$ threshold, while the interference term spectrum shows a better fit.
This means that the $I=0$ spectrum is determined below the $\bar{K}N$ threshold,
while above the $\bar{K}N$ threshold, it is limited by the interference between $I=0$ and $I=1$.
In general, the scattering amplitude is complex, and there is flexibility to adjust its phase,
i.e., to introduce a parameter representing the phase difference between $I=0$ and $I=1$.
If the phase difference is denoted by $\theta_{I=0,1}$, the relationship between the scale parameter,
which modifies the magnitude of the interference term,
and $S_{int}=\cos\theta_{I=0,1}$ can be derived from the third term in Eq.\ref{eq:Charge_piS}.

We fit the observed spectrum with DCC's Model B by introducing a free parameter that adjusts this interference term independently.
The $I=1$ spectrum is determined only from the $\pi^-\Sigma^0$ spectrum, whereas the 
$I=0$ spectrum is derived from all three $\pi\Sigma$ spectra.
The interference term is determined from the $\pi^-\Sigma^+$ and $\pi^-\Sigma^-$ spectra.
Therefore, we first fit only the $I=1$ spectrum, fixed $S_{I=1}$ at that value,
and then performed a fit to determine both $S_{I=0}$ and $S_{int}$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fit_B_phase_fixI1}.
The $\chi^2/NDF=\fitBBChi=\fitBBChiNum$ of this fit is, which was improved by introducing a phase parameter.
In this fit, the $I=0$ scale parameter $A_{I=0}$ decreases from $\fitBscaleIz$ to $\fitBBIz$,
while the $I=1$ parameter $A_{I=1}$ increases from $\fitBscaleIo$ to $\fitBBIo$.
The interference term $A_{int}$ is estimated as $\fitBBphase$ and weakened.
This value corresponds to a phase difference of $\delta\theta_{I=0,1}=\fitBBDegree$[degree] between the $I=0$ and $I=1$ interference terms.
This is considered to be due to the increase in $I=1$, which is primarily structured above the $\bar{K}N$ threshold,
being balanced by the intensity above the $\bar{K}N$ threshold for $I=0$.

Finally, there is room to further improve the fit by simultaneously fitting all parameters.
The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fit_B_phase}, where $\chi^2/NDF = \fitBChi=\fitBChiNum$, and no significant improvement is observed.
This suggests that $A_{I=1}$ is determined from a single spectrum.
Compared to the case where $A_{I=1}$ was determined first,
the parameters in this case show that $A_{I=0}$ decreased from $\fitBBIz$ to $\fitBIz$,
$A_{I=1}$ increased from $\fitBBIo$ to $\fitBIo$, and $A_{int}$ decreased slightly from $\fitBBphase$ to $\fitBphase$,
in the same direction as the introduction of $A_{int}$.
This value of $A_{int}$ corresponds to a phase $\theta=\fitBphase$ shift.
