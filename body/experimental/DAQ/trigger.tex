\subsection{Trigger Circuit}
\input{experimental/figs/trigger}
We use the signal from the counter to create a trigger signal to accumulate data.
A simplified circuit diagram for this is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:trigger}.
The most important is the physical trigger, which is used to measure the $d(K^-, N)$ spectrum due to the forward scattered nucleons.
Other triggers are for calibrating each detector and for monitoring the beam condition.

The triggers are divided into two levels depending on the speed of the signal.
The fast signal is called the first level and is produced by the counters of beamline and the CDH.
The first level sends signals to the TKO module to start data collection and these are pre-scaled into signals for beam monitoring and calibration of the CDS detector.
The signal generated by the forward counter is called the second level, shown in the lower part of Fig.\ref{fig:trigger}.
This signal is mixed with the pre-scaled first trigger and becomes the final accept signal.

The widest beam is defined from the BHD and the T0 and is used to monitor the entire beam.
Kaon beam also adds the DEF to define that it is near the target, and confirms that it is Kaon by not firing the AC.
A CDH 1hit signal is also added to the trigger for CDC track to determine the reaction point.
A forward neutral trigger is defined by NC firing and CVC and BVC not firing.
A forward charge trigger is defined by the PC or half of  CVC firing.

Table.\ref{tab:trigger} is summarized about the triggers.
