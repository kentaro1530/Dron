\subsection{Solenoid magnet}
\input{experimental/figs/CDS}

The CDS is a solenoid type spectrometer whose bore diameter is 1.18m and the length is 1.17m with an overall weight is about 23 tons.
The design of the solenoid magnet is shown in Fig\ref{fig:CDS_solenoid}.
The magnet provides a uniform field strength inside the tracking volume, 420mm front to back from the center.
In the present experiment, it is operated at 0.7T.
