\subsection{Cylindrical Detector Hodoscope - CDH}
The CDH is a segmented plastic scintillation counter used for the charged particle trigger and particle identification.
The CDH is located at a radius of 544mm from the beam axis covering a polar angle range from 54 to 126 degree corresponding to a solid angle coverage of 59$\%$ of 4$\pi$.

The CDH consists of 36 modules, individually mounted on the inner wall of the solenoid magnet.
The scintillators are mode of ELJEN EJ-200, with dimensions of 790mm in length, 99mm in width, and 30mm in thickness.
The scintillation light is transferred through light guides to a pair of Hamamatsu R7761 fine-mesh 19-dynode photomultipliers 1.5 inches in diameter.

The CDH is operated in the 0.7T magnetic field with a typical PMT gain of $\sim 10^6$.
The measured average time resolution of the CDH without a magnetic field is $71\pm3$ ps ($\sigma$), obtained with cosmic ray data. The error represents the variation among the segments.
