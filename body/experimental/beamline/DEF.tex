\subsection{Beam Definition Counter - DEF}
Beam definition counter (DEF) is mounted to the target vacumm chamber to define beam which pass through near the liquid-$D_2$ target.
The DEF is a 3mm plastic scintillator because it is placed just upstream of the liquid-$D_2$ target and multiple scattering and energy loss need to be reduced.

In our beamline, a half of kaon hits the liquid-$D_2$ target due to large beam size.
Kaon which do not hit the target increases trigger signal  for DAQ, which reduce DAQ efficiency.
The DEF signal is used to be coincided with beam trigger coincided from the T0 signal and the BHD signal  and successfully reduce the number of trigger signal about 30\%.
