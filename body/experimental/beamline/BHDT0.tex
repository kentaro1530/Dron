\subsection{BHD and T0}
The beam particles are kaon is confirmed by the TOF method using beamline hodoscope detector (BHD) and time-zero counter (T0) in the offline analysis.
The T0 is located immediately downstream of the AC.
The BHD is located between the D5 and D4 magnets, approximately 7.7m upstream of T0, i.e. the flight length is 7.7m.

The T0 is a 5-segment plastic scintillation counter array 160mm (high) $\times$ 32mm (width) $\times$ 10mm (thick), with an effective area of 160mm $\times$ 160mm.
The T0 is installed rotated 45 degrees with respect to the beam direction as the beam is horizontally spread at the T0.
A counter uses the Saint-Gobain BC420 scintillator and attached readout which is 3/4 inch Hamamatsu H6612B photomultipliers to both sides of the scintillator.

The BHD is a 20-segment plastic scintillation counter array 160mm (high) $\times$ 20mm (width) $\times$ 5mm (thick), with an effective area of 200mm (horizontal) $\times$ 160mm (vertical).
A counter uses the same photomultipliers as the T0 counter.
The BHD is installed at the most upstream of the beamline and the number of beams per spill is a few M ($\times 10^6$)events,
so the photomultipliers are attached high voltage booster to the last three dynodes to avoid gain drop due to high current by high rate beam.
