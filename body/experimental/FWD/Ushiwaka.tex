\subsection{Beam Sweeping Magnet}
The beam sweep magnets, called Ushiwaka, are located 150 cm downstream of the target and have a pole length of 70 cm.
The aperture of the Ushiwaka is 82cm (horizontal) $\times$ 40cm (vertical), which is wider than the area covered by the NC in the present experimental setup.
The Ushiwaka can be applied to 1.6T at maximum value and is applied to 1.2T in the present experiment.
