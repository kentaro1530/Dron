\subsection{Charge Veto Counter - CVC}
The charge veto counter (CVC) is installed just upstream of the NC to confirm that particles detected by the NC is actually neutral.
Half of the CVC is used to detect the proton.
The CVC consists of 34 segmented plastic scintillators whose size is 10cm (width) $\times$ 150cm (height) $\times$ 5cm (thickness).
A 2-inch Hamamatsu Photomultipliyer H6410 is attached to each side of the scintillator through a Lucite light guide.
The scintillator is of Eljen EJ-200 type. The average time resolution measured with cosmic rays is 78 $\pm$ 7 ps ($\sigma$).
The error represents the variation among the segments.
