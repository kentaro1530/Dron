\subsection{Proton Counter - PC}
The proton detector (PC) is a hodoscope array for detecting positive charged particles located immediately next to the CVC in the direction opposite to the beam dump.
The PC is a 27-segmented detector using scintillators of the same size as the CVC, i.e. it has an effective area of 270 m (horizontal) $\times$ 150 m (vertical).
% However, charged particles are bent and their bending angle depends on their momentum, so their acceptance depends on their momentum.
The photomultipliyer of the PC is the same as the CVC, but the scintillator is a Saint-Gobian BC408.
The average time resolution measured with cosmic rays is 75 $\pm$ 6 ps ($\sigma$),  i.e. the time resolution does not differ from the CVC
