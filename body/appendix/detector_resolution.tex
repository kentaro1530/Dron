The resolution of the final $\pi \Sigma$ spectrum can be categorized into two main sources:
one originating from the CDS and the other from the forward detector system.
The resolution of each detector was estimated by reproducing the mass distribution of known particles measured in our experiments,
and these values were used to estimate the resolution of the final pi-Sigma spectrum.
