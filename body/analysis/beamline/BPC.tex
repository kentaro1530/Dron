The BPC 1track is selected according to the conditions of Sec.\ref{sec:BLC}.
BLC2 and BPC require those tracks to match because there is no magnet between them.
They are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:BLC2BPC}
The left figure shows the difference in position between BLC2 and BPC in the center position and the right figure shows the difference in inclination of the tracks.
A $3\sigma$ acceptance region is set for each horizontal and vertical position and inclination, all of which are accepted as the correct beam.
The acceptance regions are indicated the read hatched in thr figure.

Fig.\ref{fig:beam_prof_FF} shows the beam profile from the BPC at the centre of the liquid deuterium target.
The left figure shows one from the unbaised kaon trigger and the right figure shows one from the CDH2 trigger, which requires that the beam has reacted with the material.
Fiducial volume accepted as the Kaon beam passed through indicated the red circle.
