This section describes the CDS acceptance correction.
For this correction, we use Monte Carlo simulation data for the $K^-d \rightarrow n \Lambda(1405)$, assuming a 2-step process,
which was also used for the template fitting in the previous section.
The CDS acceptance correction is applied not only to $d(K^-, n)\Lambda(1405)$ but also to $d(K^-, p)\Sigma^*$.
The simulation data for this correction were generated in the same way as for the $K^-d \rightarrow n \Lambda(1405)$ reaction.

The forward-going neutrons (protons) are generated with a slightly wider angular distribution (<8 degrees)
than the acceptance of the forward detector system.
However, since the purpose here is to estimate the CDS acceptance,
only the events that are detected by the forward detector are considered as the sample population.
Among these events, those that pass through the same analysis routine as the real data are regarded as valid events.
In the case of forward neutrons, the analysis includes events in which $\pi^+ \pi^-$ are detected,
followed by the selection of $d(K^-, n \pi^+ \pi^-)n$ events, and the rejection of $K^0$ and $\Sigma^{\pm}_{forward}$.
In the case of forward protons, valid events are those in which $\pi^- \pi^-$ are detected,
and are classified through the $d(K^-, p \pi^- \pi^-)\gamma p$ and $d(K^-, p \pi^-)\Lambda$ selections.

The CDS acceptances obtained for $d(K^-, n)\pi^{\mp}\Sigma^{\pm}$ and $d(K^-, p)\pi^-\Sigma^0$ are shown
in Figures \ref{fig:kn_acc} and \ref{fig:kp_acc}, respectively.



%% The acceptance of $d(K^-,n)"\pi^{\mp}\Sigma^{\pm}"$ and $d(K^-,p)"\pi^-\Sigma^0$ is corrected by MC simulations
%% in which nucleons are injected at a forward angle into the covered region of a forward detector with a uniform $\pi\Sigma$ mass distribution.
%% Since the solid angle of the forward detector is evaluated as subsection.\ref{subsec.XXX}, we adapt as the denominator the events for which the forward detector is analyzable.
%% The same analysis procedure as for the real data is applied to the MC simulation, and the final survival rate is evaluated and used as the acceptance.
%% That is, for $d(K^-, n)"\pi^{\mp}\Sigma^{\pm}"$, we apply $d(K^-, n \pi^+ \pi^-)"n"$ final state selection and rejection of $K^0$ and $\Sigma_{forward}$.
%% For $d(K^-, p)"\pi^-\Sigma^0"$, we apply the $d(K^-, p \pi^- \pi^-)"p \gamma"$ and $d(K^-, p \pi^-)"\Sigma^0"$ selections.
%% Fig.\ref{fig:kn_acc} shows the acceptance of $d(K^-, n)\pi^{\mp} \Sigma^{\pm}$.
%% Dents above the $\bar{K}N$ threshold are due to $K^0$ rejection.
%% The difference in absolute values between $\pi^- \Sigma^+$ and $\pi^+ \Sigma^-$ is due to the branching ratio of the $\Sigma$ decay.
%% Fig.\ref{fig:kp_acc} shows the acceptance of $d(K^-, p)"\pi^-\Sigma^0"$.

%% For $K^0$ production events, we use acceptance for $K^0$ kinematics because all detected particles are of $K^0$ origin.
%% We estimate the two-dimensional acceptances for $K^0$ momentum and $K^0$ scattering angles as shown in Fig\ref{fig.K0_cos_mom_acc}, and weight each event to correct for acceptances.
%% Fig.\ref{fig:K0_spec} shows acceptance corrected spectra of $K^0$ production with reproduced BG by MC simulations.
%% It can be seen that the data are concentrated in the backward and high momentum regions where the acceptances are small,
%% while the MC is distributed over the whole region as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:K0_cos_mom}.
%% In other words, the acceptance correction suppresses BG and emphasizes true $K^0$ production.
