    The red figure and blue figure shows about $d(K^-, n)"\pi^+\Sigma^-"$ and $d(K^-, n)"\pi^-\Sigma^+"$, respectively.
    The inner frame (thin line), outer frame (thick line), and error bars represent the addition of statistical errors, fitting errors, and conversion errors, which were calculated by root-mean-square.
    The green vertical lines indicates $\bar{K}N$ threshold.
