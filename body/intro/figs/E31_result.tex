  \caption{
    This picture shows the result of fitting the spectrum with E31 by Noumi et al \cite{}.
    The error bars in the upper panel represent experimental data,
    with black representing the $I=0$ spectrum calculated from $\pi^- \Sigma^+$, $\pi^+ \Sigma^-$ and $\pi^0 \Sigma^-$,
    and blue representing the $\pi^0 \Sigma^0$ spectrum with $I=0$.
    The solid red line is the result of a fit assuming a two-step reaction,
    solid and dashed represents with and without detector resolution.
    The lower panels show the scattering amplitude of the second step $\bar{K}N \rightarrow \bar{K}N$ scattering obtained by the fitting,
    where the black and red lines represent the real and imaginary parts, respectively.
    The virtical green and blue lines represents $\bar{K}N$ threshold and pole position of $\Lambda(1405)$, respectively.
