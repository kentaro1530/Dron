  $\Rightarrow$ $\Lambda(1405)$ was analyzied as a $\bar{K}N$ bound state.

  1959 R. H. Dalitz and F. taun was predicted. \\
  1961 The candidate was discoveried in $K^- p \rightarrow \pi \pi \pi \Sigma$ at the LRL. \\
  \hspace{12mm} There are ambiguity of $\pi$.\\
  1985 The high statics data was reported with 4.2 $GeV/$c $K^-$ beam\\ \hspace{8mm} by R. J. Hemingway.\\
  \hspace{10mm} $\Rightarrow$ $\pi^+ \Sigma^-$ spectrum was used first analysis by the R. H. Dalitz.
