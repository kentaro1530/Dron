In the experiments at the K1.8BR beam line, a liquid $^3$He/$^4$He and a liquid D$_2$ target will be used in the J-PARC E15/E17 and E31 experiments, respectively. 
Both target systems are combined with the CDS, which is described later. 
To have large acceptance for the secondary charged particles, an L-shaped cryostat was adopted to place the target cell at the center of the CDS.
In this section, we present an overview of both cryogenic target systems.
