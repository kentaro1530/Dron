\section{Introduction}
%===============================%
The $\bar K N$ interaction is one of the keys to understanding meson-baryon
interactions in low energy QCD incorporating three flavors in the
nuclear system.
Precise measurements of the elementary $\bar K N$ interactions and
investigations of $\bar K$-nuclear bound systems ($\bar K$ nuclei) are
hot topics presently.
The physics goal using the secondary beam line K1.8BR is to focus on the
detailed investigation of the $\bar K N$ interaction and $\bar K$
nuclei.

Extensive measurements of the anti-kaonic hydrogen atom~\cite{K-Helium}
and low-energy $\bar K N$ scattering~\cite{Kp} have shown that the $\bar
K N$ interaction is strongly attractive, but this is still not fully
understood.
In particular, the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance, which appears 27 MeV below
the $K^-p$ threshold, has been the biggest issue in understanding the $\bar
K N$ interactions and $\bar K$ nuclei structure~\cite{AY,Lambda1405}.
As a consequence of the strongly-attractive $I = 0$ $\bar K N$
interaction, the $\Lambda(1405)$ as a ``seed'' for possible $\bar
K$-nuclear quasi-bound states has been widely discussed in recent years.
Also the simplest $\bar K$-nuclear cluster, $K^-pp$, is of
special interest because it is the lightest $S = -1$ $\bar K$ nucleus,
from which evolution of dense $\bar K$ nuclei such as $K^-ppn$ and
$K^-K^-pp$ is naturally expected.
%This system has also been handled by well-established
%theoretical methods, such as variational approaches\cite{AY} and
%Faddeev calculations~\cite{Knucl}.
In recent years many theoretical works have supported the existence of
the $K^-pp$ bound state, but the predicted binding energies and widths
are widely divergent~\cite{AY,Knucl}.
Experimentally, however, only little information is
available~\cite{exp-Knucl}, which is not sufficient to discriminate
among a variety of conflicting interpretations.

Experiments using elementary $\bar K$ induced reactions are expected
to clarify such controversial $\bar K N$ interactions and $\bar K$
nuclei.
At the K1.8BR beam line of J-PARC, the following three new experiments
with the $K^-$ beam were proposed and approved.

\subsection{A search for deeply-bound kaonic nuclear states by the
in-flight $^3$He$(K^-, n)$ reaction [the E15 experiment]}
The E15 experiment searches for the simplest $\bar K$ nucleus,
$K^-pp$~\cite{E15}, whose existence was predicted by the pioneering
work of Y.~Akaishi and T.~Yamazaki\cite{AY}.
The goal of the experiment is to investigate the structure and decay of
$K^-pp$.
If the deeply bound $K^-pp$ state is found to exist as
predicted\cite{AY}, we can extend our experimental study to heavier
nuclei, such as $K^-ppn$, $K^-ppp$, etc., which are also predicted to be
deeply bound and of high density.
Such ultra high density matter is the gateway toward kaon condensed
matter where the chiral symmetry is expected to be restored.

The experiment aims to identify the nature of the $K^-pp$ bound
state by reconstructing complete kinematics of the reaction channels to
discriminate all background processes, such as multi-nucleon absorptions
and final state interactions.
An exclusive measurement is performed with the in-flight $^3$He$(K^-,n)$
reaction, which allows us to investigate the $K^-pp$ bound state
both in the formation via missing-mass spectroscopy and its decay via
invariant-mass spectroscopy using the emitted neutron and the
expected decay, $K^-pp \to \Lambda p \to \pi^-pp$, respectively.
The incident $K^-$ momentum of 1.0 GeV/$c$ is chosen to
maximize the $K^- N$ reaction rate~\cite{PDG}.

If both binding energy and width of the $K^-pp$ bound state are assumed
to be approximately 100~MeV/$c^2$ as indicated by recent experimental
results~\cite{exp-Knucl}, the missing mass resolution of the $(K^-,n)$
reaction is required to be less than 10~MeV/$c^2$ ($\sigma$) to
discriminate the $K^-pp$ signal from physical backgrounds such as the
two nucleon absorption processes from the $K^- + ^3$He interactions.
For the invariant-mass spectroscopy, a large acceptance detector
surrounding the target system is essential.
To separate the expected $K^-pp$ decay modes of $\Lambda + p$ and
$\Sigma^0 + p$, the detector is designed to identify secondary charged
particles from the target and to reconstruct the $K^-pp \to \Lambda + p$
decay with invariant-mass resolution of less than 20~MeV/$c^2$ ($\sigma$).
Additional information on the other decay channels such as $p + \Sigma +
\pi$ will also be studied.

\subsection{Precision spectroscopy of Kaonic Helium-3 3d $\to$ 2p X-rays
  [the E17 experiment]}
The aim of the E17 experiment is to determine the shift and width of the
2p state of kaonic $^3$He and $^4$He atoms with a precision better than
1 eV~\cite{E17}.
In a recent theoretical calculation, the 2p level shift of kaonic $^3$He
and $^4$He atoms was calculated by a coupled channel scheme with a
phenomenological deep potential, which accommodates the
existence of deeply-bound kaonic nuclear states~\cite{KatomA}.
Contrary to the calculations with optical models which provide a very
small 2p level shift below 1 eV~\cite{Katom}, the coupled-channel
calculation claims the possibility of a large 2p level shift ($\sim$ 10
eV) for kaonic $^3$He and/or $^4$He atoms depending on the strength of
the $\bar K$-nucleus potential.
Therefore, precision measurements of the energy shift of the 2p level of
kaonic $^3$He and $^4$He are a matter of great interest and can impose
the most stringent constraint on the $\bar K$-nucleus strong interaction
parameters.

By stopping negative kaons in a liquid helium target and using
high-resolution silicon drift X-ray detectors (SDDs), it is possible to
measure the strong-interaction shift of 3d $\to$ 2p X-rays from kaonic
$^3$He and $^4$He atoms. 
To carry out the measurement of the X rays with the world's
highest precision, i.e., better than~1 eV , we will achieve better energy
resolution and higher statistics than those of the E570 experiment at
KEK~\cite{E570} and the SIDDHARTA experiment at LNF~\cite{SIDDHARTA}.
In addition, we will apply the techniques which worked for E570; the
in-beam energy calibration with fluorescence X-rays and the background
reduction by a reaction vertex reconstruction.

\subsection{Spectroscopic study of hyperon resonances below the $\bar{K}N$
  threshold via the $(K^-, n)$ reaction on the deuteron [the E31
  experiment]}
The primary goal of the E31 experiment is exclusively to show the
spectral function of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance produced in the $\bar
K N \to \pi \Sigma$ channel via the in-flight $(K^-,n)$ reaction on the
deuteron~\cite{E31}.
Despite many experimental attempts and theoretical analysis
related to the $\Lambda(1405)$, the most fundamental unsettled question
remains ``is the $\Lambda(1405)$ located at 1405 MeV/$c^2$ or at 1420
MeV/$c^2$?''. 
So far, in the Review of Particle Physics by the Particle Data
Group~\cite{PDG2010}, the existence of $\Lambda(1405)$ was
established using only M-matrix analysis by R. H. Dalitz, {\it et
al.}~\cite{Dalitz}, in which the estimated mass of the $\Lambda(1405)$ is
1406.5 $\pm$ 4.0 MeV/$c^2$ with a full width of 50 $\pm$ 2 MeV/$c^2$
based on the $K^-p \to (\pi^-\Sigma(1670)^+ \to \pi^-\pi^+\Lambda(1405))
\to \pi^-\pi^+\pi^-\Sigma^+ \to \pi^-\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+n$ reaction data
samples in the hydrogen bubble chamber at a kaon momentum of 4.2
GeV/$c$~\cite{exp-lam3}.
In addition to the above, the new review of 2012~\cite{PDG} adopted $M =
1405 ^{+1.4}_{-1.0}$ from J. Esmaili, {\it et al.}~\cite{Esmaili} based on
the old bubble chamber data of stopped $K^-$ in $^4$He~\cite{exp-lam1}.
%In addition, the chiral theory predicts a 2nd $K^-p$ pole at 1420
%MeV/$c^2$ or higher.

Theoretically, the resonance has been interpreted as an $I=0$
quasi-bound state, embedded in the $\Sigma-\pi$ continuum.
In recent years, strongly attractive $\bar{K} N$ interactions were
deduced from a coupled-channel approach based on the ansatz that the
$K^-$ bound state is located at 1405 MeV/$c^2$, and were used to
predict strongly bound and dense $\bar{K}$ nuclear states~\cite{AY}.
On the other hand, recent analyses based on the chiral unitary model
claim that the $\Lambda(1405)$ has two pole structure;
one is the $\pi\Sigma$ state and the other is the $\bar KN$ state, which
results in a resonance position of about 1420 MeV/$c^2$ in the $\bar K N
\to \pi \Sigma$ channel and thus a much shallower binding scheme,
predicting much weaker bound $\bar{K}$ systems~\cite{Lambda1405}.  
This controversy should be solved by new experiments.

To clarify the nature of the $\Lambda(1405)$, decomposition of
$\Lambda(1405)$ states coupled to $\bar KN$ is essential.
To this end, in E31, precise measurements of the $K^-d \to \pi\Sigma n$
reaction (where production is directly coupled to the $\bar K N$
interaction channel) will be used to study the nature of the
$\Lambda(1405)$.
Missing-mass spectra in the inclusive $(K^-,n)$ reaction on the deuteron
target will be measured with a resolution of less than 10~MeV/$c^2$
($\sigma$).
The beam momentum of 1.0 GeV/$c$ will be used for the reasons outlined
in the E15 section.
All the  $\Sigma^+ \pi^-$, $\Sigma^- \pi^+$, and $\Sigma^0 \pi^0$ final
states must be identified.
Therefore, the experimental requirements of E15 also satisfy those of
E31.
In addition to the E15 requirement, E31 also requires the detection and
identification of a backward going proton from the $\Lambda(1405) \to
\pi^0 \Sigma^0$ decay followed by $\Sigma^0 \to \gamma \Lambda \to \gamma
\pi^- p$, because the $\Lambda(1405)$ recoils at a backward angle,
i.e., the angular distribution of decay protons is boosted backward.

\section{Detector overview}
%===============================%
A dedicated spectrometer was designed and constructed at the K1.8BR beam
line to satisfy all the experimental requirements described in the
previous section.
The spectrometer consists of a high precision beam line spectrometer, a
liquid $^3$He/$^4$He/D$_2$ target system, a Cylindrical Detector System
(CDS) that surrounds the target to detect the decay particles from the
target region, and a neutron time-of-flight counter array located
$\sim$15~m downstream from the target position, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:spectrometer}.
In the following, a brief overview of the detector system at K1.8BR
is provided.

    Cylindrical Detector System that surrounds the liquid
    $^3$He/$^4$He/D$_2$ target system to detect the decay particles from
    the target region, the beam sweeping magnet, and the neutron
    time-of-flight counter located $\sim$15~m downstream from the target
    position.}
    \label{fig:spectrometer}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}  

The secondary beam line K1.8BR was constructed at the hadron hall
of the J-PARC 50~GeV Proton Synchrotron (PS).
The 30~GeV primary proton beam accelerated by the PS is transported to
the hadron hall through the beam switching yard and is focused on the
secondary-particle-production target, T1.
%The K1.8BR beam line branches off from K1.8 at a bending magnet
%downstream of an electrostatic separator, ES1, used to purify secondary
%beams of charged particles.
%The K1.8BR beam line is designed to deliver separated charged particles
%with momenta up to 1.2 GeV/$c$.
The K1.8BR beam line branches off from K1.8 at a bending magnet
downstream of an electrostatic separator, ES1, used to purify secondary
beams of charged particles in the K1.8BR beam line with momenta up to
1.2 GeV/c.
The configuration is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:K18BR} and its parameters
are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:K18BR}.
The length of only 31.3~m optimizes transport of low-momentum kaons.
The intensity of a 1.0~GeV/c $K^-$ beam is expected to be 
%$\sim 1 \times 10^6$ per spill (6 seconds repetition)
$8 \times 10^4$ per second
based on an estimation
using the Sanford-Wang formula~\cite{SanfordWang}.
An operational beam power of 270~kW (30~GeV, 9~$\mu$A proton beam)
striking a 54~mm thick nickel target (30~\% loss target) was assumed.
Details of the beam line, such as the beam line elements and optical
design, are described in Ref.~\cite{Ieiri}.

The beam line spectrometer is composed of beam line magnets, trigger
counters, beam trackers, and a kaon identification counter.
The beam line magnets, composed of an SQDQD system, are located
downstream of a branching magnet D3.
The beam trigger is a coincidence signal from two trigger counters
located downstream from magnets D3 and D5, separated by a 7.7~m flight
path.\footnotetext[1]{Parameters in February 2012.}
Kaon beams ranging in momentum from 0.9 to 1.2~GeV/$c$ are identified
with a kaon identification counter.
Pions in the beams are discriminated from kaons using the kaon
identification counter, and protons are removed by ES1.
Trajectory of the kaon beam is tracked with the two beam line chambers
installed across the D5 magnet.
The kaon momentum is analyzed using this tracking information
together with beam optics of the D5 beam line magnet to attain an
expected momentum resolution of $\sim$0.1~\%.
The beam line spectrometer was completed in January 2009, when the first
beam was delivered to the J-PARC hadron hall.

The liquid $^3$He/$^4$He target system, whose design is based on the
techniques developed for the $^4$He target used by KEK-PS E471, E549,
and E570, is located at the final focus.
In E17, the stopped-$K^-$ experiment, X-ray measurements are performed
using the SDDs installed in the target chamber.
For E31, a liquid D$_2$ target system similar to the $^3$He/$^4$He
system has been developed.
The liquid $^3$He/$^4$He target system was completed in 2008, and the
SDDs were ready in 2010.

Decay particles from the target are detected by the CDS which
consists of the solenoid magnet, the Cylindrical Drift Chamber (CDC),
and the Cylindrical Detector Hodoscope (CDH).
The CDS has a solid angle coverage of 59~\% of 4$\pi$.
Detailed tracking information of charged particles is obtained from the 
CDC which operates in a solenoidal magnetic field of 0.7~T.
Particle identification is obtained using time-of-flight (TOF) together
with the trigger counter.
The basic CDS system was completed in 2008, and new detectors for
the CDS upgrade have been developed.

A forward neutron generated by the in-flight $(K^-, n)$ reaction is
detected by a forward neutron TOF counter array.
TOF distance, optimized to be $\sim$15~m from the target, will enable us
to achieve a total missing mass resolution of less than 10 MeV/$c^2$
($\sigma$) with $\sim$150 ps TOF resolution of the system.
To perform efficient on-line particle identification of forward
neutral particles by the neutron TOF counter, the incident beam which
passes through the target is bent by a sweeping magnet placed just after
the CDS.
The neutron TOF counter and the sweeping magnet were installed in
2012.

\section{Beam line detectors}
%===============================%
A schematic view of the beam line spectrometer is presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:beamline}.
It is composed of beam line magnets, trigger counters, beam trackers,
and a kaon identification counter.
The beam trigger is generated by a coincidence signal of a Beam Hodoscope
Detector (BHD) and a Time Zero counter (T0), whose flight length between
the BHD and T0 is 7.7~m.
The kaon beam of momentum around 1.0 GeV/$c$ is identified by using an
aerogel Cherenkov counter (AC) with a refractive index of 1.05.
The kaon beam is tracked with two beam trackers -- a Beam Line Chamber 1
(BLC1) and a Beam Line Chamber 2 (BLC2) -- and the momentum of the kaon
is analyzed with this tracking information together with beam optics of
the D5 beam line magnet.
These basic detectors are common for all the experiments at the K1.8BR
beam line.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{fig/beamline.eps}
    \caption{Schematic view of the beam line spectrometer, which
    consists of the trigger counters (BHD and T0), the beam line
    chambers (BLC1 and BLC2), and the kaon identification counter (AC).}
    \label{fig:beamline}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}  

In addition to the above detectors, an energy measurement counter (E0)
and a vertex beam line drift chamber (VBDC) are used in the
stopped-$K^-$ experiment E17.
To stop the kaons in the target, the kaon beam of 0.9
GeV/$c$ is degraded by carbon and copper blocks placed after T0.
The degraded kaons are transferred into the target through E0 and the
VBDC, and stopped inside the target. 
The reaction vertex is obtained from an incident kaon and an outgoing
secondary charged particle track reconstructed by the VBDC and the CDC,
respectively.
By applying a correlation cut between the reaction vertex in the beam
direction and the energy loss in E0, in-flight kaon decay/reaction
events are rejected and continuum background events are drastically
reduced as a result.

\subsection{Trigger counters}
The BHD and T0 are segmented plastic scintillation counters
located downstream of the D3 and the D5 magnet, respectively.
The T0 signal is used as the event time-zero signal.

The BHD has an effective area of 400~mm (horizontal) $\times$ 160~mm
(vertical) segmented into 20 units horizontally, and T0 is 160~mm
(horizontal) $\times$ 160~mm (vertical) segmented into 5 units
horizontally.
To avoid over concentration of the beam on one segment, T0 is
rotated by 45 degrees.
The BHD scintillator is made of Saint-Gobain BC412 whose unit size
is 160~mm (height) $\times$ 20~mm (width) $\times$ 5~mm (thickness).
The unit size of the Saint-Gobain BC420 scintillator in T0 is 160 mm
(height) $\times$ 32~mm (width) $\times$ 10~mm (thickness).
In both of the trigger counters, the scintillation light is transferred
to a pair of 3/4~inch Hamamatsu H6612B photomultipliers which are
attached to the top and bottom ends.
Since the coincidence rate of the top and bottom photomultipliers will
reach $\sim$1~M counts per spill, high voltage bleeders of all
photomultipliers are modified to supply adequate current to the last three
dynodes.
Discriminated signals from the top and bottom photomultipliers
are coincidenced and provide the timing of each segment.
The typical TOF resolution between the BHD and T0 is 160~ps ($\sigma$)
after a slewing correction is applied.


\subsection{Kaon identification counter}
For the kaon beam trigger, the AC located downstream of T0 is used to
identify the kaon.
Kaons in the momentum region from 0.9 GeV/$c$ to 1.2 GeV/$c$, used for
the experiments at K1.8BR, are clearly separated from pions.

The AC, which uses SP-50 silica aerogel produced by Matsushita Electric
Works, has an effective area of 166~mm (width) $\times$ 166~mm (height)
$\times$ 50~mm (thickness).
Cherenkov photons radiated in the beam direction are reflected by forward
optical mirrors and read out by four photomultipliers as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:AC}.
The single-photon-sensitive Hamamatsu H6559UVB photomultipliers have a
3~inch diameter photocathode on UV-transparent glass windows.

AC pulse height distributions for 1.0 GeV/$c$ pions and kaons, which
are obtained by summing ADC spectra of the four photomultipliers, are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:AC_ADC}.
In the figures, particle identifications are performed by the TOF method
between the BHD and T0 in off-line analysis.
On-line pion identification is performed by the AC at a threshold level
of $\sim$5 photoelectrons.
A pion detection efficiency of 97~\% is achieved, whereas the miss
identification ratio of a kaon as a pion is 1~\%.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Beam line chambers}
Kaon beam tracking is performed with two similar planar drift chambers,
BLC1 and BLC2, installed across the D5 magnet.

BLC1 consists of two sets of the same design of drift chamber, BLC1a and 
BLC1b, which have 8 layers with a $UU'VV'UU'VV'$ configuration.
In the $U$ and $V$ layers the wires are tilted by $\pm$ 45 degrees.
Each layer contains 32 sense wires with a drift length of 4~mm
corresponding to an effective area of 256~mm $\times$ 256~mm.
The number of readout channels is 256 for both BLC1a and BLC1b, which are
installed 300~mm apart upstream of the D5 magnet.

BLC2 is similar to BLC1; BLC2 consists of two sets of the same
drift chamber, BLC2a and BLC2b.
Each chamber has a $UU'VV'UU'VV'$ configuration and 32 sense wires per
layer, i.e, the number of readout channels is 256 for both BLC2a and
BLC2b.
In the $U$ and $V$ layers the wires are tilted by $\pm$ 45 degrees.
The drift length of 2.5~mm corresponds to an effective area of 160~mm
$\times$ 160~mm.
BLC2a and BLC2b are installed 275~mm apart downstream of the D5
magnet.

Both BLC1 and BLC2 use 12.5 $\mu$m diameter gold-plated tungsten wires
with 3~\% rhenium and 75 $\mu$m diameter copper-beryllium wires for the
sense and potential wires, respectively.
The cathode planes are made of 12.5 $\mu$m aluminized Kapton.
The read-out electronics of both chambers consist of a preamplifier
card with Amplifier-Shaper-Discriminator ICs (ASD,
SONY-CXA3653Q~\cite{ASD}, $\tau$ = 16~ns) mounted on the chambers, an
LVDS-ECL converter, and a TDC.
The output signal of the ASD board is sent to the LVDS-ECL converter board
via 7 m-long twisted-pair cables.
From the LVDS-ECL converter, the signal is transferred to the counting
house with 50 m-long twisted-pair cables.
Chamber gas is an argon-isobutane mixture passed through a methylal
(dimethoxy-methane) bubbler at refrigerator temperature of
4 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$ with the ratio of 76~\% (Ar), 20~\% (Isobutane)
and 4~\% (Methylal).
The operating voltages of BLC1 and BLC2 are set at -1.25~kV on both the
potential wires and the cathode planes.
Typical position resolutions of 150~$\mu$m and detection efficiencies of
99~\% for both BLC1 and BLC2 have been obtained.

\subsection{Detectors for the stopped-$K^-$ experiment}
E0, a segmented plastic scintillation counter which has an
effective area of 102~mm (horizontal) $\times$ 90~mm (vertical),
segmented into 3 units horizontally, is located just downstream of the
degraders.
The E0 scintillator is made of Eljen EJ-230 whose unit size
is 102~mm (height) $\times$ 30~mm (width) $\times$ 20~mm (thickness).
The scintillation light is transferred through light guides to a pair of
1~inch fine-mesh Hamamatsu H6152-01B photomultipliers attached to the
top and bottom ends.
The high voltage bleeders of the photomultipliers are modified to supply
additional current to the last three dynodes.

The VBDC planar drift chamber is located just before the target
system, hence was designed to be installable within the 30
cm inner diameter of the CDC.
It is 250~mm in diameter and 73.2~mm in height and consists of 8 layers
with a $UU'VV'UU'VV'$ configuration, where each layer contains 16 sense
wires with a drift length of 2.5~mm corresponding to an effective area
of 80~mm $\times$ 80~mm.
In the $U$ and $V$ layers the wires are tilted by $\pm$ 45 degrees.
The sense and potential wires are the same as those for the beam line
chambers.
The cathode planes are made of 7.5 $\mu$m-thick Kapton, of which both
sides are coated by 0.1 $\mu$m aluminum with a layer of 0.0025 $\mu$m
chromium as protection against oxidization.
The read-out electronics and gas mixture are as those for the beam line
chambers.

For the in-flight experiments E15 and E31, E0 and VBDC are replaced
by the detectors for the CDS upgrade, the TGEM-TPC, the BPC, and the
BPD detectors, which are described later.

\section{Cylindrical detector system}
%===============================%
A schematic view of the Cylindrical Detector System (CDS) with the
target system is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDS}.
The CDS consists of the solenoid magnet, the Cylindrical Drift
Chamber (CDC), and the Cylindrical Detector Hodoscope (CDH).
The decay particles from the target are reconstructed by the CDC which
operates in a magnetic field of 0.7~T provided by the solenoid magnet.
The CDH is used for particle identification and as a charged particle
trigger.
The CDC and the CDH are common and basic detectors for all the
experiments at the K1.8BR beam line.

For in-flight experiment E15 and E31, additional detectors -- a Time
Projection Chamber (TPC) with Thick Gas Electron Multipliers (TGEMs), a
Backward Proton Chamber (BPC), and a Backward Proton Detector (BPD) --
will be installed.
To realize an efficient measurement of the decay mode $K^-pp
\to p\pi\Sigma$, the TPC has been developed as an inner tracker for the
E15 upgrade which will be installed between the target and the CDC.
The BPC and the BPD have been developed aiming to reconstruct backward
going particles which cannot be detected by the CDC.
The BPC and the BPD, which are installed just upstream of the target
system, enable measurement of a proton emitted from the $\Lambda(1405)
\to \pi^0 \Sigma^0$ decay mode ($\Sigma^0 \to \gamma \Lambda \to \gamma
\pi^- p$) by the time-of-flight method. 
The BPC and the BPD are useful detectors for the E15 experiment
also, because the requirement of a particle in the backward direction
permits an expansion of the acceptance in $\Lambda p n$ 3-body
kinematical phase space.

\subsection{Solenoid magnet}
The spectrometer magnet of the CDS is of a solenoidal type, whose bore
diameter is 1.18~m and the length is 1.17~m with an overall
weight of 23 tons. 
Design of the solenoid magnet is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:solenoid}.
It is located on the final focus point of the K1.8BR beam line.
The magnet provides a uniform field strength inside the tracking
volume ($|z| <$ 420~mm), whose strength is 0.7~T at the center of
the magnet.

    \label{fig:solenoid}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}  

\subsection{Cylindrical drift chamber}
The CDC is a cylindrical wire drift chamber that contains 15 layers of
anode wires.
The structure of the CDC is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDC_structure}.
The outer radius is 530~mm, the inner radius is 150~mm with a total
length of 950~mm.
The wire length of axial layers is 838.8~mm, thus the angular coverage
is 49$^\circ$ $< \theta <$ 131$^\circ$ in the polar angle region
corresponding to a solid angle coverage of 66~\% of 4$\pi$.

The CDC consists of two aluminum end-plates of 20~mm thickness, a
1~mm thick CFRP cylinder as the inner wall of the CDC, and six aluminum
posts which are placed outside the tracking volume.
The CDC uses gold-plated tungsten of 30~$\mu$m$~\phi$ for the sense
wires, and gold-plated aluminum of 100~$\mu$m$~\phi$ for the field and
guard wires.
These wires are supported by feedthroughs with a bushing inserted at
the end.
Bushes with an 80 and 200 $\mu$m$~\phi$ hole are used for the sense and
field/guard wires, respectively.

The CDC has 15 layers of small hexagonal cells with a typical drift
length of 9~mm, which are grouped into 7 super layers as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CDC_cell}.
Table~\ref{tab:CDC} gives the detailed parameters of the wire
configuration.
The layers are in the radial region from 190.5~mm (layer \#1) to 484.5~mm
(layer \#15).
The 8 stereo layers tilted by about 3.5$^\circ$ are used to obtain
longitudinal position information.
The number of readout channels is 1816 and the total number of
wires in the CDC is 8064.

The drift gas is 1 atm of mixed argon (50~\%) - ethane (50~\%).
A high voltage is applied to the field and guard wires, and the sense
wires are kept at ground potential.
For the first super layer (A1) and the second one (U1) a high voltage
of -2.8 kV is applied to the potential wires, and -2.7 kV to
the potential wires of the other super layers.
Also -1.5 kV, -1.8 kV, and -0.6 kV is applied to the inner-most, the
outer-most, and the other guard wires, respectively.
The read-out electronics of the CDC consists of a preamp card with ASDs
(SONY-CXA3653Q, $\tau$ = 16~ns), an LVDS-ECL converter, and a TDC --
the same as those for the beam line chambers. 

Figure~\ref{fig:CDCeff} shows layer efficiencies of the CDC which were
obtained in the engineering run conducted in June 2012.
The efficiency is evaluated by (number of tracks having hits in the
relevant layer) / (number of tracks reconstructed except for hits in
the relevant layer).
All layers have efficiencies over 99~\%.
Also the typical residual distribution of the CDC as obtained is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:CDCres}.
A typical intrinsic resolution of 200 $\mu$m was determined in the
data analysis.

The momentum resolution of the CDC, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:momres},
was estimated by a Monte Carlo simulation using the GEANT4
toolkit~\cite{GEANT4}.
In the simulation, the resolution of the CDC as well as energy loss and
scattering in detector materials were taken into account.
The calculated $p_t$-resolution was 8.4~\% $p_t \oplus $ 1.1~\%
$/ \beta$ and the estimated vertex resolution was 2.1~mm and 5.0~mm for
perpendicular and parallel direction to the beam axis, respectively.

\subsection{Cylindrical Detector Hodoscope}
The CDH is a segmented plastic scintillation counter used for the charged
particle trigger and particle identification.
%Particle identification is performed with the TOF information, whose
%start timing is provided by the T0, together with a flight length and a
%momentum given by the track fitting by the CDC. 
The CDH is located at a radius of 544~mm from the beam axis covering
a polar angle range from 54 to 126 degrees corresponding to a solid
angle coverage of 59~\% of 4$\pi$.

The CDH consists of 36 modules, individually mounted on the inner wall
of the solenoid magnet.
The scintillators are made of Eljen EJ-200, whose dimensions are 790~mm
in length, 99~mm in width, and 30~mm in thickness.
The scintillation light is transferred through light guides to a pair of
Hamamatsu R7761 fine-mesh 19-dynode photomultipliers 1.5 inches in
diameter.

The CDH is operated in the 0.7~T magnetic field with a typical PMT gain
of $\sim10^6$. 
The measured average time resolution of the CDH without a magnetic field
is 71 $\pm$ 3 ~ps ($\sigma$) -- obtained with cosmic ray data.

\subsection{TGEM time projection chamber}
The TPC with TGEMs has been developed to perform precise
vertex reconstruction for hyperon decays such as $\Lambda$ and
$\Sigma^{\pm}$, as an inner tracker of the CDS.
The TPC is installed between the target and the CDC.
For the TPC, the spatial resolution in the Z direction should be less
than 1~mm, and the material budget in the CDC acceptance should
be minimized. 

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fig/TPC.eps}
    \caption{Design of the TGEM-TPC (all dimensions in mm).}
    \label{fig:TPC}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}  

The design of the TPC is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TPC}.
It is cylindrical in shape with inner diameter 170~mm, outer
280~mm, and is filled with P-10 gas (90 \% Ar+ 10 \% CH$_4$) at
atmospheric pressure.
The drift length is 30~cm in a field cage made from double-sided
Flexible Printed Circuits (FPC) having staggered strip electrodes with a
width of 8~mm and pitch of 10~mm, connected with 1 M$\Omega$ resistors.
A drift field of 150 V/cm is applied to the field cages.
For amplification, a double or triple-TGEM structure is used; the TGEM
is economically constructed from double-clad 400-$\mu$m-thick FR4 plate
using standard Printed Circuit Board (PCB) techniques, and has
mechanically drilled holes~\cite{TGEM}.
To reduce both the energy and the propagation probability of
a discharge, the TGEM for the TPC has a nonagonal shape whose sides
are subdivided into three sectors and separately connected externally to
the voltage supply through high-value resistors.
High voltages are applied to the double/triple-TGEM resistor chain
through connectors penetrating the end cap.
The gain of these nonagonal TGEMs is greater than $10^4$ with graphite
electrodes having a resistance of about 30 $\Omega$/$\Box$ both with
double- and triple-TGEM configurations as shown in
Fig~\ref{fig:TPC-gain}.
The graphite-electrode TGEM is a new development to protect the detector
and the readout electronics from damage by any occasional
discharge~\cite{RETGEM}.
The layout of the readout system is also nonagonal and is divided into 4
$\times$ 4 pads on each side with 4 mm-long and 20 mm-wide pads printed
on a standard PCB (the total number of readout channels is 144). 
For the TPC front-end electronics, preamplifier cards with ASDs (
SONY-CXA3653Q, $\tau$ = 80~ns) are used, i.e., the TPC provides only
beam-direction information of tracks.

To evaluate the TPC performance, a test experiment using a
positron beam of around 600 MeV/$c$ was performed at the Laser-Electron
Photon facility at SPring-8 (LEPS)~\cite{LEPS} in November 2011.
%[Research Center for Electron Photon Science
%(ELPH) test experiment #2742].
In the test experiment, the TPC was operated without the magnetic field
with only a part of the readout system installed.
The typical spatial resolution in the Z direction obtained was 
0.95 mm and 1.9 mm at the drift length of 30 mm and 270 mm,
respectively.
Tracking efficiency of over 95 \% was achieved independent of the drift
length.
The drift length dependence of the spatial resolution can be expressed as
$\sigma_z^2 = \sigma_0^2+C_d^2 \cdot z / N_{eff}$, where $\sigma_z,
\sigma_0, C_d, z$, and $N_{eff}$ are total resolution, resolution
without diffusion, diffusion constant, drift distance, and effective
number of electrons, respectively~\cite{TPC}.
With the value of $C_d$ = 0.34 mm and electric field of 150 V/cm in the
P-10 gas in an evaluation by the gas simulation program
Magboltz~\cite{Magboltz}, the values of $\sigma_0$ = 0.73 mm and
$N_{eff}$ = 7.7 were obtained.
When operating in a magnetic field, the resolution and efficiency are
expected to improve resulting from an increase in the effective
number of electrons.
This increase should achieve design criteria.
The TPC will be completed in 2012 followed by a performance test in
which all of these basic parameters will be experimentally determined.

\subsection{Detectors for backward protons}
The BPC and BPD are installed just upstream of the target system
aiming to reconstruct backward going particles, such as pions and
protons, which cannot be detected by the CDC.

The BPC is a compact circular planar drift chamber located just
before the target system 168~mm in diameter and 89.7~mm in height.
Figure~\ref{fig:BPC} shows the design of the BPC which consists of 8
layers with a $XX'YY'XX'YY'$ configuration, where wires of the $Y$ layer
are tilted by 90 degrees.
Each layer contains 15 sense wires with a drift length of 3.6~mm
corresponding to an effective area with a 111.6~mm diameter.
The number of readout channels is 120.
The cathode planes are made of 9~$\mu$m carbon aramid foil, and
sense and potential wires, read-out electronics and gas mixture of the
BPC are the same as those for the beam line chambers.
The operational voltage of the BPC is set at -1.45~kV on both the
potential wires and the cathode planes.
In the engineering run of 2012, individual layer efficiencies were
greater than 99~\% and the position resolution was 150~$\mu$m.

    \caption{Design of the BPC (all dimensions in mm).}
    \label{fig:BPC}
   \end{center}
  \end{figure}

The BPD is a plastic scintillator hodoscope array which is placed 0.5 m
upstream from the final focus, inside the solenoid magnet.
The size of the BPD is 350 mm (horizontal) $\times$ 340 mm (vertical)
segmented into 70 units.
Each scintillation counter, made of Eljen EJ-230, is 5~mm $\times$ 5~mm
$\times$ 340~mm.
Due to the strong magnetic field and a limited space, Multi-Pixel Photon
Counters (MPPC) with a 3 mm $\times$ 3 mm sensitive area were used
(Hamamatsu S10362-33-050C).
The MPPCs were put on both sides of each slab.
Signals from the MPPCs are read out by fast timing amps (ORTEC FTA820).
A typical time resolution of 160 ps has been achieved in the engineering
run, which is sufficient to identify a particle in the backward
direction.

\section{Neutron time-of-flight counter and beam sweeping magnet}
%===============================%
The neutron TOF counter, placed $\sim$15~m away from center of the
target at 0 degrees with respect to the beam direction, detects a
forward neutron generated by the in-flight $(K^-, n)$ reaction.
The neutron TOF counter is an array of scintillator counters previously
used by KEK-PS E549, which was reassembled for the E15 experiment.
The kaon beam is swept out from the acceptance of the neutron counter by
a sweeping magnet placed just after the CDS to perform
efficient on-line particle identification of forward neutral particles.
Charged particles within the acceptance of the neutron counter, such as
those generated on the wall of the beam sweeping magnet, are vetoed by a
charge veto counter located just upstream of the neutron counter.
In addition, a beam veto counter is installed between the CDS and the
beam sweeping magnet to reduce fake triggers caused by the decay of beam
kaons after the target.

To measure both the $^3$He($K^-$, $p$) and the ($K^-$,
$n$) reaction, a proton TOF counter was installed.
The comparison of the two kinds of missing-mass spectra will provide
unique information on the isospin dependence of the kaon-nucleus ($\bar
K$-NN) interaction.
The proton counter is located alongside the charge veto counter, as an
extended wall of the charge veto counter, on the opposite side of a beam
dump to which the beam is bent by the beam sweeping magnet.
Figure~\ref{fig:NC} shows a schematic view of the neutron counter, the
charge veto counter, and the proton counter.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]

    counter, and the proton counter.

    position.}

\subsection{Neutron time-of-flight counter}
A forward neutron generated by the in-flight $(K^-, n)$ reaction is
detected by the neutron TOF counter located 14.7~m away
from the final focus point in which the experimental target is installed.
The neutron TOF counter consists of an array of scintillation counters
which has an effective volume of 3.2~m (horizontal)
$\times$ 1.5~m (vertical) $\times$ 0.35~m (depth) segmented into
16-columns (horizontal) $\times$ 7-layers (depth) units.
The acceptance of the neutron counter is $\pm$ 6.2$^\circ$ in the
horizontal direction and $\pm$ 2.9$^\circ$ in the vertical.
Each scintillation counter has dimensions of 20~cm (width) $\times$
150~cm (height) $\times$ 5~cm (thickness) viewed by 2~inch Hamamatsu H6410
photomultipliers attached to both long sides of the scintillator through
a Lucite light guide.
The scintillators for the first three layers are made of Saint-Gobain
BC408, and the other four layers are made of Saint-Gobain BC412.
The average time resolution of the neutron counter, measured with cosmic
rays, is 92 $\pm$ 10~ps ($\sigma$).
The detection efficiency for a $\sim$1 GeV/$c$ neutron is estimated to
be $\sim$ 35 \% from the Monte Carlo simulation by the GEANT4 toolkit.


\subsection{Beam sweeping magnet}
A dipole magnet named Ushiwaka which was used in the $\pi$2 beam line of
the 12 GeV proton synchrotron at KEK is used as the beam sweeping
magnet.
It is located just downstream of the CDS.
The magnet has an aperture of 82~cm (horizontal) $\times$ 40~cm
(vertical) and a pole length of 70~cm, and is capable of providing a
maximum field of 1.6 T.
To sweep the beam away from the neutron counter acceptance
window and transfer the beam to the beam dump, the magnet provides a
field strength of $\sim$1.2 T at the center of the magnet.

\subsection{Charge veto counter}
The charge veto counter is located upstream of the neutron counter,
14.0~m away from the final focus point.
This counter is used as a charge veto counter for the neutron detector.
It has an effective area of 3.4~m (horizontal)
$\times$ 1.5~m (vertical) segmented into 34 units.
Each scintillation counter has dimensions of 10~cm (width) $\times$
150~cm (height) $\times$ 3~cm (thickness), and is equipped with two
2~inch Hamamatsu H6410 photomultipliers attached to
both long sides of the scintillator through a Lucite light guide.
The scintillators are of Eljen EJ-200 type.
The average time resolution measured with cosmic rays is 78 $\pm$ 7~ps
($\sigma$).

\subsection{Proton time-of-flight counter}
The proton TOF counter is installed as the extended wall of the
charge veto counter.
%, whose momentum acceptance for the proton is greater
%than 1.0 GeV/$c$.
It has an effective area of 2.7~m (horizontal) $\times$ 1.5~m (vertical)
segmented into 27 units.
Each scintillation counter consists of a Saint-Gobain BC408 scintillator and
two Hamamatsu H6410 photomultipliers attached to both long sides of the
scintillator through a Lucite light guide. 
%The time resolution of the charge veto counter and the proton TOF counter
%are an average of 80 $\pm$ 9~ps ($\sigma$) with cosmic ray data.
The average time resolution of the proton counter, obtained from cosmic ray
data, is 75 $\pm$ 6~ps ($\sigma$).

\subsection{Beam veto counter}
The beam veto counter is installed between the CDS and the beam
sweeping magnet.
The size of the beam veto counter is 315~mm (height) $\times$ 315~mm (width)
$\times$ 10~mm (thickness) made of Saint-Gobain BC408.
The scintillation light transferred through a light guide is read by a
2~inch fine-mesh Hamamatsu H6154 photomultiplier.
The high voltage bleeder of the photomultiplier is modified to supply
additional current to the last three dynodes.

%===============================%
\section{Trigger and data acquisition}
%===============================%

\subsection{Trigger}
To meet experimental requirements, the dedicated hardware trigger is applied
to each experiment.
The kaon beam trigger is common for all experiments, whereas, 
main triggers for the in-flight experiment (E15 and E31) and for
the stopped-$K^-$ experiment with the SDDs (E17) are substantially
different.
The E15 and E31 experiments use a 1.0 GeV/$c$ kaon beam, and detect
a forward neutron generated by the $^3$He or d$(K^-, n)$ reaction.
The E17 experiment uses a kaon beam of 0.9 GeV/$c$ which is stopped in
the liquid target by using degraders located just upstream of
the target system.
\begin{description}
 \item[(1) kaon beam trigger]\mbox{}\\
	    The elementary beam trigger is constructed by coincidence
	    signals from the beam line counters, the BHD and T0.
	    The kaon beam trigger $(K_{beam})$ is selected from the beam
	    trigger by using the kaon identification counter, i.e., a
	    veto signal of the AC ($\overline{AC}$) defines the kaon beam.
	    It is to be noted that (anti-) protons in the beam are
	    eliminated upstream of the beam line by using the ES1,
	    CM1, and CM2.
	    A logical expression of the kaon beam trigger is given as, 
	    \begin{eqnarray} 
	     \nonumber
	      (K_{beam}) \equiv (BHD) \otimes (T0) \otimes (\overline{AC}).
	    \end{eqnarray}
 \item[(2) E15 main trigger]\mbox{}\\
	    A two-level trigger logic for the in-flight $^3$He$(K^-,
	    n$) reaction is applied.
	    To reconstruct the expected decay $K^-pp \to
	    \Lambda p \to p\pi^-p$ using the CDS, the event with two or
	    more CDH hits ($CDH_2$) is selected from the kaon beam
	    trigger in the first level ($E15_{1st}$).
	    In addition, no hit on the beam veto counter
	    ($\overline{BVC}$) is required to reduce the trigger rate.
	    In the second level ($E15_{2nd}$), the event with the
	    forward neutron is chosen by requiring a neutron counter
	    hit ($NC$) and a veto signal of the charge veto counter
	    ($\overline{TOF}$).
	    The E15 main trigger is given as, 
	    \begin{eqnarray} 
	     \nonumber
	      (E15_{1st}) &\equiv& (K_{beam}) \otimes (CDH_2) \otimes
	      (\overline{BVC}), \\
	     \nonumber
	      (E15_{2nd}) &\equiv& (E15_{1st}) \otimes (NC) \otimes
	      (\overline{TOF}).
	    \end{eqnarray}
 \item[(3) E17 main trigger]\mbox{}\\
	    A two-level trigger logic is applied to measure
	    X-rays from the kaonic helium 3 and 4 atoms.
	    The stopped-$K^-$ trigger ($K_{stopped}$) is generated
	    by the signal from E0 and the veto-signal from
	    the beam veto counter with the kaon beam definition:
	    \begin{eqnarray} 
	     \nonumber
	      (K_{stopped}) \equiv (K_{beam}) \otimes (E0) \otimes
	      (\overline{BVC}).
	    \end{eqnarray}
	    For the first-level trigger ($E17_{1st}$), one or more CDH
	    hits ($CDH_1$) is required to reduce the trigger
	    rate and obtain the reaction vertex.
	    A hit in the SDD is required in the second level, because
	    the timing of the SDD signal from the shaping amplifier is
	    too late for the trigger timing of the first level.
	    Therefore the E17 main trigger is,
	    \begin{eqnarray} 
	     \nonumber
	      (E17_{1st}) &\equiv& (K_{stopped}) \otimes (CDH_1), \\
	     \nonumber
	      (E17_{2nd}) &\equiv& (E17_{1st}) \otimes (SDD).
	    \end{eqnarray}
 \item[(4) E31 main trigger]\mbox{}\\
	    A two-level trigger logic for the in-flight d$(K^-,
	    n$) reaction is applied.
	    Since E31 measures $\Lambda(1405)$ decays into $\pi^0
	    \Sigma^0 \to \pi^0 \gamma \Lambda \to \pi^0 \gamma \pi^- p$
	    and $\pi^\pm \Sigma^\mp \to \pi^\pm \pi^\mp n$ using the CDS
	    in addition to the forward neutron, the trigger logic is the
	    same as for the E15 trigger except for a requirement for one
	    or more CDH hits in the first level.
	    Thus the E31 main trigger is,
	    \begin{eqnarray} 
	     \nonumber
	      (E31_{1st}) &\equiv& (K_{beam}) \otimes (CDH_1) \otimes
	      (\overline{BVC}), \\
	     \nonumber
	      (E31_{2nd}) &\equiv& (E31_{1st}) \otimes (NC) \otimes
	      (\overline{TOF}).
	    \end{eqnarray}
\end{description}


\subsection{Data acquisition system}
The on-line data acquisition system (DAQ) for the experiments at
K1.8BR consists of the TKO\cite{TKO}, VME, and PC Linux.
The signals from the detectors are fed into ADC and TDC modules slotted
into the TKO crates.
In the K1.8BR experiments, 10 TKO crates are used and they are parallel
read from VME-SMP (Super Memory Partner)\cite{SMP} via TKO SCH (Super
Controller Head).
The data stored in a buffer memory of the SMP is transferred to the
DAQ-PC through the SBS Bit3 VME-to-PCI bridges.
Additionally the E17 experiment uses another system which consists of
the VME (flash-ADC modules) and PC Linux for the read-out of the SDDs.
The data is written to the disk on the DAQ-PC, and transferred to a PC
cluster server at RIKEN via Internet.

%===============================%
\section{Spectrometer performance}
%===============================%
The quality of the secondary kaon beam is key for all of the experiments
at K1.8BR.
We have optimized the beam line from 2009 to obtain an intense and good
$K/\pi$-separated kaon beam by tuning the beam line spectrometer.
During a commissioning run in February 2012, beam line commissioning for
1.0~GeV/$c$ was accomplished and optimized parameters for the
spectrometer were obtained.
Details of the beam line performance are described in Ref.~\cite{Ieiri}.
It should be noted that the typical 1.0 GeV/$c$ kaon yield normalized by
the accelerator power of 1.0 kW was obtained to be 10 k / spill with a
$K/\pi$ ratio of 0.3, when a 60~mm thick platinum target (50~\% loss
target) was used as the secondary-particle-production target, T1.
Figure~\ref{fig:beam-tof} demonstrates particle separation by
time-of-flight between the BHD and T0.
To perform on-line particle identification in the
commissioning run, two Cherenkov counters located downstream of the D5
magnet were used in addition to the AC; a gas Cherenkov counter (GC,
refractive index n = 1.002) and a water Cherenkov counter (WC, n = 1.33)
\footnote{
The on-line particle identification of electrons, pions, kaons, and
protons is performed with coincidence signals from $(GC)$, $(\overline{GC})
\otimes (AC)$, $(\overline{GC}) \otimes (\overline{AC}) \otimes (WC)$, and
$(\overline{GC}) \otimes (\overline{AC}) \otimes (\overline{WC})$,
respectively.}.
Each particle species is clearly separated in the time-of-flight
spectrum.
% with the time resolution of 160~ps ($\sigma$).

   counters.
   }
   \label{fig:beam-tof}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

An engineering run with the full setup of the E15 experiment, i.e., the
CDS with the liquid $^3$He target system and the neutron counter, was
also conducted in June 2012.
%Commissioning of the CDS with a liquid $^4$He target was also conducted
%in February 2012.
Charged particles from the target were tracked by the CDC, and momentum
information was obtained with a magnetic field of 0.7~T provided by
the solenoid magnet.
The event vertex was obtained from trajectories of the beam and the
secondary-particles which were reconstructed by the BPC and the CDC,
respectively.
The reconstructed beam-profile at the final focus point is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FF-prof-BPC1}, and Fig.~\ref{fig:CDC-target} demonstrates
the event-vertex reconstruction in which the liquid helium target cell
and transfer pipes are clearly seen.

 direction to the beam axis are shown.

\end{figure}

The identification of secondary charged particles was performed by
the CDH using TOF measurements together with T0.
Here the flight length was calculated from the event vertex and the
particle trajectory.
Figure~\ref{fig:pid} shows the distributions of the momentum versus
1/$\beta$.
Pions, kaons, protons, and deuterons are clearly separated.
The TOF resolution between T0 and the CDH is typically 160~ps
($\sigma$).
Using the momentum reconstruction and the particle identification,
the invariant mass of $p \pi^-$ was reconstructed as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:lambda}.
A clear peak of $\Lambda \to p \pi^-$ decay can be seen.
As a direct demonstration of the spectrometer performance, the mass
resolution of $\Lambda \to p \pi^-$ decay was compared to the
expectations from the detailed detector simulation.
The centroid of $\Lambda$ is obtained as 1113.6 $\pm$ 0.1~MeV/$c^2$ (known
to be 1115.7 MeV/$c$) with a Gaussian resolution of 3.5 $\pm$
0.1~MeV/$c^2$, whereas the expected centroid is 1113.4~MeV/$c^2$ with a
resolution of 3.5~MeV/$c^2$; the CDS performance has been reproduced by
the simulation.
The expected invariant mass resolution of the $K^-pp \to \Lambda p$
decay is evaluated to be 10 MeV/$c^2$ with the simulation, which is
sufficient to satisfy the E15 requirement of less than 20 MeV/$c^2$
($\sigma$).

  \end{center}
 \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Forward going neutral particles were also successfully detected and
identified by the neutron counter in the engineering run.
The resultant $1/\beta$ spectrum of the neutral particles is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:NC-TOF} in which charged particles are vetoed by the beam
veto counter and the charge veto counter.
%The resultant TOF spectrum of the neutral particles between T0 and the
%neutron counter is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:NC-TOF} in which charged
%particles are vetoed by the beam veto counter and the charge veto
%counter.
$\gamma$ rays and neutrons are clearly separated in the spectrum.
The TOF resolution between T0 and the neutron counter is typically
150~ps ($\sigma$).
With the measured TOF resolution, the expected missing mass resolution
for the $^3$He$(K^-,n)K^-pp$ reaction is evaluated to be 9~MeV/$c^2$
($\sigma$), which satisfies the E15 requirement of less than 10 MeV/$c^2$
($\sigma$).

\section{Summary}
%===============================%
A new spectrometer system was designed and constructed at the secondary
beam line K1.8BR in the hadron hall of J-PARC.
The experiments at the K1.8BR beam line aim to investigate $\bar K N$
interactions and $\bar K$-nuclear bound systems.
The E15 [kaonic-nuclei search via in-flight $^3$He$(K^-,  n$)], the E17
[kaonic-atom X-ray measurement with stopped-$K^-$], and the E31
[spectroscopic study of $\Lambda(1405)$ via in-flight d($K^-, n$)]
experiments were proposed and approved at the K1.8BR beam line.
The spectrometer consists of the high precision beam line
spectrometer, the liquid $^3$He/$^4$He/D$_2$ target system, the
Cylindrical Detector System that surrounds the target to detect the
decay particles from the target region, and the neutron time-of-flight
counter located $\sim$15~m downstream from the target position.
Commissioning of the beam line spectrometer and engineering run with the
full setup of the E15 experiment were successfully performed with a 1.0
GeV/$c$ kaon beam in February and June 2012, respectively.
%In the commissioning and engineering run, expected performance of the
%spectrometer has been confirmed.
The results obtained show that the design goal of the spectrometer has
been achieved.
The experiments at K1.8BR are ready now, and physics output will be
reported in near future.
