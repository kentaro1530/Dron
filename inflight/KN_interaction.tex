\subsection{$\Lambda(1405)$ and $\bar{K}N$ interaction}
The $\Lambda(1405)$ is the lowest excited state of the $\Lambda$ which has strangeness $S=-1$ with isospin $I=0$ and spin and spin-parity $J^P=(\frac{1}{2})^-$.
In the latest particle data group (PDG) \cite{PDG}, the mass and the width of the $\Lambda(1405)$ are assigned to $1405.1^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$MeV and $50.5\pm 2.0$MeV respectively,
based on several articles \cite{Dalitz, HADES_pheno, Esmaili}.

The existance of the $\Lambda(1405)$ was first predicted by Dalitz and Taun in 1959 as the quasi-bound state of the $\bar{K}N$ \cite{Dalitz_1st}.
A candidate for this state was reported in the $K^- d \rightarrow \pi \pi \Sigma$ reaction with a 1.15$GeV/$c $K^-$ beam in 1961 at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory\cite{L1405_LRL}.
Comparing the spectrum of the neutral $\pi \Sigma$, i.e. the $K^- p \rightarrow \pi^{\pm} \pi^{\mp} (\pi^{\pm} \Sigma^{\mp})$ state,
with the spectrum of the doubly charged pi sigma,
i.e. the $K^- p -> \pi^+ \pi\+ (\pi^- \Sigma^-)$ or $K^- p \rightarrow \pi^- \pi^- (\pi^+ \Sigma^+)$ state,
it was found that the $\Lambda(1405)$ regions showed an event excess.
However, there were problems with this data, such as insufficient statistics to determine the lineshape of the $\Lambda(1405)$
and difficulties in identifying the $\pi$ involved in the $\pi \Sigma$ final state.
Therefore, Hemingway reported on the production of $\Lambda(1405)$ with high statistics using the
$K^- p \rightarrow \pi^- \Sigma^+(1660) \rightarrow \pi^- \pi^+ \Lambda(1405) \rightarrow \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^{\pm} \Sigma^{mp}$ reaction with a 4.2$GeV/$c $K^-$ beam \cite{Hemingway}.
They increased the purity of $\Sigma^+(1660)$ production by restricting the $K^- p \rightarrow \pi^- \Sigma^+(1660)$ momentum transfer to be small, $t'(p \rightarrow \Sigma^+(1660)) < 1.0 GeV$/c.
In particular, the $K^- p \rightarrow \pi^- \Sigma^+(1660) \rightarrow \pi^- \pi^+ (\pi^- \Sigma^+)$ reaction,
the charges of $\pi$ decaying from $\Sigma^+(1660)$ and from $\Lambda(1405)$ are different, resulting the lineshape of the $\Lambda(1405)$ without background due to wrong $pi$ combinations.
Dalitz and Deloﬀ analysed this spectrum using the M-matrix method and found the mass and width of $\Lambda(1405)$ at $1406.4 \pm 4.0$MeV and $50\pm 2$MeV, respectively\cite{Dalitz}.


Hemingway reported the high-statistics production of $\Lambda(1405)$ using a $4.2$ GeV $K^-$ beam\cite{Hemingway}.



Dalitz and Deloff applied M-matrix/K-matrix analysis to the $\pi^-\Sigma^+$ spectrum,
and evaluated the mass and width of $\Lambda(1405)$ at $1406.4 \pm 4.0$MeV and $50\pm 2$MeV, respectively\cite{Dalitz}.
This data is employed PDG's estimation for the mass and width of $\Lambda(1405)$.
