abstract = {An extensive search for resonant states has been performed through an energy dependent partial wave analysis of KN data in the momentum region 777 – 1226 MeV/c. The K−p → K−p, KOn differential cross sections, polarization angular distributions and total K−p cross sections were included in the fit. In addition to the well established hyperons, evidence is reported for a resonant state Σ(1760) of JP=12− and for the assignment JP=32+ for a Λ(1870) state previously assigned to JP=72+. From the K−p differential and total cross sections between 436 and 1226 MeV/c the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude has been derived as a function of K− incident momentum. These results are found to be consistent with the predictions of several dispersion relation calculations.}
