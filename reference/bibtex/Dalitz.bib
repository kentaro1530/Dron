	abstract = {The experimental pi - Sigma + mass spectrum for the reaction K-p to Sigma + pi - pi + pi + at 4.2 Gev c-1 is fitted up to the K-p threshold by a number of phenomenological models, using the M-matrix, the K-matrix and separable potentials in the ( pi Sigma ,KN) coupled channels. The best estimate for the mass of Lambda (1405) is 1406.5+or-4.0 MeV, with a full width of 50+or-2 MeV, although there is some discordance between these models, each of which gives an acceptable fit to this spectrum.}
