abstract = {The angular distributions of the reactions K-p→K-p and K-p→KK0n have been measured at 23 incident K- momenta between 1.136 and 1.798 ifGeV/c using the bubble chamber technique. These data, together with other published data on the same reactions, including K-p polarisations, K̄N total cross sections, and measurements of Re ƒ(0)/Im ƒ(0), have been analysed in terms of partial-wave amplitudes. Resonance behaviour is confirmed for the P03 partial wave at 1890 MeV. The resonance parameters of the F15(1915), F17(2030) and G07(2100) have been redetermined. No evidence has been found for new resonances coupling significantly to KKN in the energy region explored.}
