abstract = "The reactions K−d→Σ−p, K−d→Σ−(1385)p, K−d→Λ(1405)n and K−d→Λ(1520)n have been studied at K− momenta between 686 and 844 MeV/c in an experiment with the 81 cm Saclay bubble chamber at CERN. About 630 000 pictures have been analyzed. Partial and differential cross sections are presented. A one-nucleon-exchange model is used to extract the kaon-nucleon-hyperon coupling constants from these results. For g(KNΣ(1197)), g(KNΣ(1385)) and g(KNΛ(1405)) we find values which are compatible with the SU(3) predictions. The coupling constant g(KNΛ(1520)) obtained by our method agrees with that determined from the partial decay width for Λ(1520)→KN."
