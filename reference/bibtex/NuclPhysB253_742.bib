abstract = {From a 130 event/μb exposure of the CERN 2 m hydrogen bubble chamber to a 4.2 GeV/c K− beam, a high statistics sample of Λ(1405) in a production reaction has been isolated. The reaction K−p→Σ+(1660)π−, Σ+(1660)→Λ(1405)π+, Λ(1405)→Σπ has enabled an almost pure selection of Λ(1405) events. A Byers-Fenster spin-parity analysis is in agreement with the J = 12 assignment but gives no parity discrimination. The measured line-shape of the Λ(1405) is particularly useful in allowing a better understanding of the nature of this resonance.}
