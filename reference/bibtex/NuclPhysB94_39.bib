abstract = {An exhaustive partial-wave analysis of the reaction KN → Λπ has been carried out on a compilation of all available data using two separate semi-energy-independent methods. Particular attention has been given to finding all ambiguous solutions. Two possible solutions are found consistent with the physical assumptions imposed. The parameters of the resonances appearing in the two solutions are given.}
