abstract = "The three-body final states Σ±π∓K0, Σ0π0K+ and Λπ0K+0 produced from πp interactions at 1.69 GeV/c are examined. The quasi-two-body state Λ(1405)K0 is discussed in detail. In particular, the spin of Λ(1405) is determined, via the method of Byers and Fenster, to be consistent with 12. The Σ±π∓ mass spectrum is compared to that produced by various zero-range and effective-range parametrizations and the Λ(1405) is found to have a mass of 1405 MeV and width of 45–55 MeV. Production and decay characteristics of the quasi-two-body states Σ(1385)0K0 are reported."
