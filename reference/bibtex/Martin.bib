abstract = "A multichannel analysis of low-energy KN data is presented, which simultaneously is required to satisfy dispersion relation constraints coming partly from the measured real parts of the forward K±N amplitudes and partly from forward K−p → K0n and KS0p → KS0p data. The K±N scattering lengths are determined, and the KN nucleon coupling constants found to be gΛ2 = 13.9 ± 2.6 and gΣ2 ⩽ 3.3 ± 1.1. The forward amplitudes are tabulated."
