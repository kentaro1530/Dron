abstract = "The Λ(1405) baryon resonance plays an outstanding role in various aspects in hadron and nuclear physics. It has been considered that the Λ(1405) resonance is generated by the attractive interaction of the antikaon and the nucleon as a quasi-bound state below its threshold decaying into the πΣ channel. Thus, the structure of Λ(1405) is closely related to the K̄N interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study few-body systems with antikaon. In this paper, after reviewing the basic properties of the Λ(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical coupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity of the scattering amplitude. We show that the structure of the Λ(1405) resonance is dominated by the meson–baryon molecular component and is described as a superposition of two independent states. The meson–baryon nature of Λ(1405) leads to various hadronic molecular states in few-body systems with strangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic interactions. We summarize the recent progress in the investigation of the Λ(1405) structure and future perspective of the physics of the Λ(1405) resonance."
