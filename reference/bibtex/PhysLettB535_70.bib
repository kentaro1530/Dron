abstract = "We propose to use the (K−,π−) and (π+,K+) reactions to produce deeply bound nuclear K̄ states in proton-rich systems, in which an elementary formation of Λ(1405) and Λ(1520) plays the role of a doorway state. Exotic discrete K̄ bound systems on unbound nuclei, such as K−pp, K−ppp and K−pppn, are predicted to be produced, where a high-density nuclear medium is formed as a result of nuclear contraction due to the strong K−–p attraction."
