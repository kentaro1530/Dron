abstract = {We perform a combined analysis of antikaon–nucleon scattering cross sections and the recent SIDDHARTA kaonic hydrogen data in the framework of a K¯N–πY coupled-channel Bethe–Salpeter approach at next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion of the effective potential. We find a precise description of the antikaon–proton scattering amplitudes and are able to extract accurate values of the scattering lengths, a0=−1.81−0.28+0.30+i0.92−0.23+0.29 fm and a1=+0.48−0.11+0.12+i0.87−0.20+0.26 fm. We also discuss the two-pole structure of the Λ(1405).}
