abstract = {An energy-dependent partial-wave analysis of K−p→Λπ0 has been performed over the energy range 1537 to 2215 MeV, using the world data sample for dσ/dω and (dυ/dω)P in the form of Legendre polynomial coefficients. Improved parameters for The F15(1920) resonance have been obtained: ER = 1920 MeV, Γ = 102 MeV, t = −0.09. In addition to the established D 13 (1660), D15 (1765)anand F17 (2040) states, resonance parameters are given for possible Σ resonances in S11(1700), D13(1950), P11(1670), S11(2000), F15(2250), P11(1985) and P13(1925). Details of the analysis are presented and tentative SU(3) assignments are discussed. A further paper will discuss the uniqueness of these solutions.}
