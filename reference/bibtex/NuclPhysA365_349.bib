abstract = "The nucleon momentum distribution in the deuteron has been determined up to 340 MeV/c by measuring the d(e, e′p)n reaction at an incident electron energy of 500 MeV. The data are well described even above p = 200 MeV/c by the most recent deuteron wave functions, in contrast with previous (e, e′p) and (p, 2p) results."
