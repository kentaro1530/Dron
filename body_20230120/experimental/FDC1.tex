\subsection{Forward drift chamber}
The forward drift chamber (FDC1) was attached to the Ushiwaka magnet to measure the trajectory of the forward proton before sweeping for the decision of flight-length.
The FDC1 is a planer type dift chamber that has 6 layers consists of UU'-XX'-VV'.
UU' and VV' layers were tilted $\pm 30 ^{\circ}$ about the beam axis.
Each layer has a 6mm gap in each sense wires and each pair plane was located at 20mm.
