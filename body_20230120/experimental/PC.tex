\subsection{Proton counter}
The proton counter (PC) was placed at opposite side of beam sweeping direction to measure inflight-$(K^-, p)$ reaction.
The PC consists of 27 segmented plastic scintillators whose size is the same as the CVC.
The PC has 2.7m (horizontal) and 1.5m (vertical) effective area. 
The scintillators made of Saint-Gobian BC408.
The Hamamatsu H6410 was attached both side of scintillator through the Lucite light guide.
