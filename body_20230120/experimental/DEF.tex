\subsection{Beam definition counter}
The beam definition counter (DEF) was installed just upstream of the target the vacuum chamber for the definition of the beam to avoid particle not hitting the liquid deuterium target.
In our beamline, a half of kaon hits the experimental targets due to large beam size.
High trigger rate not only is the cause of low data quality but also the cause of decreasing DAQ efficiency due to computer busy,
so the DEF signal was coincided with beam trigger made by the T0 and BHD and was used reducing beam trigger rate.
The trigger rate was successfully suppressed by about 30\% by this counter.
